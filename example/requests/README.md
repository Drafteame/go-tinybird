# Example - Multiple request

This example demonstrates how to use multiple request to Tinybird.

To run this example:

```shell
export TB_TOKEN="<your-api-token>"
go run .
```

Please, update the [pipe name](https://github.com/the-hotels-network/go-tinybird/blob/main/example/requests/main.go#L24) in this code with your tinybird account, and set the token value.
